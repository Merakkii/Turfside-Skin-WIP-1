While you are welcome to jump right in, there are a few thing you should know first! Don't let the length of the journal scare you, Turfside is very intuitive once you've gotten started. Please read this guide and the linked information carefully. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the Discord server! We'd be happy to help!</div></div></div>
<h1>PLAYER LIMITS and REFRESH</h1><div class="whitebox">Turfside runs on a weekly schedule. Each player is limited in the number of Trainings, Races and Leases they can do each week. The exact maximum limit depends on the type of Trainer hired, the type of Jockey hired, Backstretch pass bonuses (if purchased), and the player's PR Bonuses.&nbsp;

Once you have reached your weekly limit, you will be unable to submit more until the "refresh". Each week, this <b>refresh occurs on Sunday at 11:59 PM CST</b>. Please keep in mind that the refresh is performed manually by staff, so occasionally it may run a little late and we thank you for your patience! After the refresh, every player's limits are reset so they can submit again. A countdown can be found on :devturfside:'s page on the top right.&nbsp;

<h1>CURRENCY SYSTEM and REFERRALS</h1><div class="left"><div class="whitebox">You may have noticed when you joined, you were gifted 50,000 Coins!&nbsp;This fictional currency is the <i>only</i> form of currency approved for essential group elements (horses, slots, items). 

<b>You may <u>NOT</u> sell or buy horses/slots/etc for dA points, real currency, or any other form of fictional currency</b>. Only coins. Extra elements that <i>don't</i> impact game-play, such as Stable Maps, YHHs, etc., may be bought with any type of currency. 

A player's up-to-date coin balance is recorded in The Vault.&nbsp;You can earn coins by racing, offering horses up for breedings, selling horses and unused items, referrals, advertising the group, leasing other players' horses for a fee, and so on.&nbsp;</div></div><div class="right"><div class="purplebox"><h3>Referrals and Advertising</h3><b>Each time a player lists you as their referrer upon joining, you'll be eligible to earn 10,000c Coins.</b> There is no limit on referrals! However, the new player must obtain their first horse (via any method) and hire a Trainer and Jockey before your account will be credited.

<b>Additionally, advertising Turfside</b> in a Poll, Journal,&nbsp; Status, Art submission (with the description advertising TS), or comment (discord or dA) will earn you 5,000c. This can be done <b>once per month. </b>Note the group with proof to redeem. A r<u>equirement</u>&nbsp;is that you must mention a feature of Turfside you like the most in your advertisement and link to the group.</div></div><div class="clear"></div><div align="center"><small><a href="https://sta.sh/01x1msyutfnh#top">Back to Top</a></small></div>

<h1>TRAINER INFORMATION</h1><div class="whitebox">In Turfside, horses have <b>5 different stats</b> (Speed, Stamina, Breaking, Power, Courage) that helps determine how successful they'll be in races. In order to increase a horse's stats, you must first<a href="https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/798609698/4735584820"> hire a Trainer</a>. Once hired, the fee will be deducted from your Vault and the Trainer will work for you for one IRL month. Your trainer's "expiration date" will be listed in The Vault under column "TED".&nbsp; Your "TU" shows how many trainings you have available.</div><div class="hh"><div class="ll"><div class="purplebox">There are four different Trainers types, the more expensive, the more you can train your own horses and lease others' horses!</div>

</div></div></div><div class="rr"><div class="whitebox">When a trainer's contract expires, you may choose to rehire them or select a different trainer type. You may also fire a trainer before the one month contract is finished.

For example, if you previously had a Rookie Trainer and you fire him and hire an All-Star Trainer, your weekly Training and Leasing limits will jump from 20 to 50 the moment the new trainer is hired. 

This is the same when downgrading Trainers. If you had an All-Star Trainer hired and you fire him to hire a Rookie Trainer, your training and leasing limit drops immediately from 50 to 20. 

<b>If this causes you to be over your limit</b>, then you won't be able to train until the refresh and your TU is reset.</div></div>

<h1>JOCKEY INFORMATION</h1><div class="whitebox">Racing allows players to earn coins, PR Bonuses, and rise on the leader board!

Jockeys now require an up-front fee and will work for you for one month like a Trainer. When you hire a Jockey, it'll be listed under "Jockey Type" in The Vault and their expiration date will be listed under "JED."

<h1>LEASING INFORMATION</h1><div class="whitebox">Each player has the option to lease <i>out</i> their horses to let other players train and/or race them. They can also take <i>in </i>leases to train and/or race other people's horses. A player must have a Trainer hired to accept leases, because the Trainer determines a player's leasing limits (LL). 

Additionally, if a player hopes to race a leased horse, they must have a Trainer <i><u>and</u></i> Jockey hired.&nbsp;Unlike Training and Racing Limits, Leasing Limits can not increase through PR Bonuses. Your Leasing Limit depends entirely on which trainer you have hired at the moment in time.</div><div class="purplebox"><h3>IMPORTANT : Regarding Leasing Another Player's Horse to Race</h3>It is important to note that the <u>owner</u> of the horse gets the purse from winning races! Additionally, Wallets are not allowed in leases as it is not attached to the horse, but the player. Please keep this in mind when&nbsp;negotiating leases.</div><div align="center"><small><a href="https://sta.sh/01x1msyutfnh#top">Back to Top</a></small></div>

</div>
<h1>PR BONUSES</h1><div class="mods-hh split-65"><div class="mods-column-ll"><div class="whitebox">Each time a player is awarded a PR Bonus, they <b>permanently receive +5 additional trainings and races per week.</b> This bonus adds on to the limit set by the player's hired Trainer and Jockey, <i>which are still required to make requests.</i> To earn this bonus, a player must get their horse to 100 PR by racing them successfully (see the teal box). A player can earn a maximum of 10 PR bonuses total, with bonuses only given once per horse.

For example, a player with a Rookie Trainer and Rookie Jockey would have 20 Training and 20 Races each week <i>normally</i>. But if that player were to have 10 horses with at least 100 PR, then that player would enjoy a total of 70 Training and 70 Races each week!

</div></div><div class="mods-column-rr"><div class="tealbox"><h3>Earning PR</h3>When a horse does well in races, it will earn PR depending on its placement.

<div align="center"><b>1st Place</b> = 15 PR</div><div align="center"><b>2nd place</b> = 7 PR</div><div align="center"><b>3rd Place</b> = 3 PR</div><div align="center"><b>4th / 5th Place</b> = 1 PR</div><div align="center">Everything Else = 0 PR</div></div></div></div><div align="center"><small><a href="https://sta.sh/01x1msyutfnh#top">Back to Top</a></small></div>

<h1>STALL INFORMATION</h1><div class="whitebox" align="left">In order to house more horses -- whether they are obtained through buying customs, from a player, or breeding two horses to create a foal -- you must first have space in your stable! <b>There are two types of stalls</b>; Adults and Maternal.&nbsp;You can view the stalls you own and the ones available for purchase (along with their prices) in the Vault. When you begin playing Turfside, you receive one free Adult stall to fill with your first horse!</div><div class="left"><div class="purplebox"><h3>Adult Stalls</h3>These stalls are for your Adult horses. Each player can have a maximum of 15 adult stalls, which means a player can have a maximum of 15 horses in their stables at any given time.

In order to expand your Stable to house more horses, you must purchase additional Adult Stalls. A player can unlock and purchase as many Adult Stalls they wish at any given time, as long as they have the Coins to do so. 

In "The Vault", stalls that are available for a player to purchase will have its price written in grey ink. Stalls that are owned by a player, but are unoccupied, will be labeled as "Available" with bolded black ink. Finally, stalls that are occupied by a horse will have that horse's ID# in bolded red ink and pink BG.
</div></div><div class="right"><div class="purplebox"><h3>Maternity Stalls</h3>Maternal Stalls are specially made to house foals and yearlings. A stable must have at least one Maternal Stall available in order to breed their mares, although you can still stud your stallions out to other stables that have a Maternal Stall unlocked.

When a foal is born at your stables, it will live in the Maternal Stall until it ages to Adulthood. At that point, it will be automatically moved into an available Adult stall. <b>If there is no space</b>, you will receive a notice that you have two weeks to correct the issue by making space or selling the foal.

After two weeks and the issue hasn't been corrected, you will be given a second warning and an additional one week. If the problem is still not fixed at this time, your stable will be frozen and unable to participate in Turfside until the issue is resolved.

<h1>GUIDE TO THE TURFSIDE SPREADSHEET</h1><div class="whitebox">In Turfside, we use Google Spreadsheets to keep track of players and their horses.

<h1>OBTAINING and RETIRING HORSES</h1><div class="left"><div class="whitebox"><h3>OBTAINING HORSES</h3>Now that we've covered the basics and you've received your gift of one free Adult stall, you're ready for your first horse! Players can obtain horses through buying custom imports, buying horses from other players, winning a bid on a horse at the Auction House, as prizes, and by breeding two horses together to create a foal. 

<b>Players with less than three horses get a discount on Customs</b>, so it is recommended for new players go there for their first horse. Remember that in the future you will need to purchase a stall <i>before</i> getting additional horses!</div></div><div class="right"><div class="whitebox"><h3>"RETIRING" / DECEASING YOUR HORSE</h3>As mentioned, a player can have a maximum of 15 adult stalls, which means you can only house 15 horses at a time. Eventually, it may be necessary to get rid of horses to make space for new ones. Players can sell their horses to other stables, go through the "Buy Back" program, or simply "retire" their horses. 

Retirement is an irreversible action which removes the horse from your stable so they can no longer be trained, raced, or sold, nor can new slot bookings be made. There is no item to bring back a retired horse, so be confident in your decision. <b>To retire, please note the group with the horse's name and ID!</b></div></div><div class="clear"></div><div align="center"><small><a href="https://sta.sh/01x1msyutfnh#top">Back to Top</a></small></div>
