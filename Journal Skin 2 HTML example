The group is designed to revolutionize the racing experience on DeviantArt and allow anyone in the community to play without the need for art, literature, or money. Everyone may participate! We are excited to welcome you into the group. Joining is a very simple process, but first we need to go over our Code of Conduct!</div></div></div><div class="tealbox"><div align="center">The following guidelines ensures the group functions smoothly and is fun for everyone. <span>Rules are subject to change and will be enforced.</span></div></div><div class="charcoalbox"><div class="scroll">
<div class="left"><div class="gold">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>I. Treat staff and fellow players with respect.&nbsp;</b></div>If you have an issue with someone, please either resolve it privately or contact the group for assistance. Do not cause drama anywhere in Turfside, including the Discord chat.

<div class="gold"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; II. No cheating!&nbsp;</b></div>Do not use alternate accounts, exploit limits, or anything else that would cause you to act in secret. Please report any loopholes you find in the game so that they can be resolved. Fairness is keystone to our game.

<div class="gold"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; III. Admin ruling is final.&nbsp;</b></div>We love to receive feedback from our members and are quick to correct any mistakes on our part, but please do not argue with Admins over the results of any training, racing, breeding, etc, or any other decisions that are made.

<div class="gold"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;IV. The group is not responsible for enforcing any personal rules on breeding,&nbsp;</b></div>and will only intervene if there is an issue with payment or upholding the agreed-upon deal as outlined in the booking comment. There are no "reclaims" or reversing of breedings.

<div class="gold"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; V. All sales are final.&nbsp;</b></div>Whether they be item, horse or breeding slot. Please keep this in mind when making deals with other players. Once you sell something, you cannot forcibly take it back. If you aren't comfortable with this, avoid selling to other players.</div><div class="right"><div class="gold"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; VI. Discrimination is absolutely not permitted.&nbsp;</b></div>Includes, but isn't limited to: racism, homophobia, sexism, and all other forms of offensive and discriminatory actions/language.&nbsp;<b><u>Similarly, horse names may not contain pejoratives/slurs.</u>
</b>
<div class="gold"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; VII. Essential game elements cannot be sold in exchange for any currency except Turfside Coins.</b></div>This means horses, items, breeding slots, etc., can <u>not</u> be sold for dA points or any other type of real or fictional currency. However, nonessential things <i>that don't impact gameplay</i> (like stable maps, YHHs, etc), however, can be sold for any currency, coins or otherwise.

<div class="gold"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; VIII. Owners are responsible for avoiding overbooking of breeding slots.&nbsp;</b></div>The group's breeding log spreadsheet only tracks USED breedings, not booked. If you sell more slots than what the horse has available, you will be held responsible for compensation.

<div class="gold"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; IX. Do not upload designs on the group base to your personal dA account or anywhere else.&nbsp;</b></div>They must stay in sta.sh unless posted to :devturf-king: (the group's offical admin/design account).

<div class="gold"><b>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;X. Horse names may not contain stable prefix or suffixes. Also, a horse's name and design is permanent.&nbsp;</b></div>Unless a special item, known as the Typewriter and XXXX, respectively, is purchased in the Marketplace.</div>
