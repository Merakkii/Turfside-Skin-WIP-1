While you are welcome to jump right in, there are a few thing you should know first! Don't let the length of the journal scare you, Turfside is very intuitive once you've gotten started. Please read this guide and the linked information carefully, and if you have any questions&nbsp; feel free to ask in the Discord server! We'd be happy to help!</div></div></div>
<h1>CURRENCY SYSTEM and REFERRALS</h1><div class="whitebox">You may have noticed when you joined, you were gifted 50,000c!&nbsp;This fictional currency, known as "Coins", is the only form of currency approved for essential group elements (horses, slots, items, etc). <b>You may NOT sell or buy horses/slots/etc for dA points, real currency, or any other form of fictional currency</b>. However, extra elements that don't impact game-play, such as Stable Maps, YHHs, Commissions, etc., may be bought with any type of currency, coins or otherwise. This is to maintain fairness and balancing of item rarities.&nbsp;&nbsp;A player's up-to-date coin balance is recorded in The Vault.&nbsp;You can earn coins by racing your horses, offering horses up for breedings, selling horses and unused items, and so on. 

<h3>Referral System</h3>Each time a player lists you as their referrer upon joining, you'll earn Coins (10,000c). Additionally, advertising Turfside in a Poll, Journal, or comment (whether in discord or dA) will earn you 5,000c. This can be done <b>once per month</b>, you must note the group to redeem these Coins. A requirement for the journal, poll, or comment, is that you must mention a feature or function of Turfside you like the most.

<h1>PLAYER LIMITS and REFRESH</h1><div class="whitebox">Turfside runs on a weekly schedule. Each player is limited in the number of Trainings, Races and Leases they can do each week. The exact maximum limit depends on the type of Trainer hired, the type of Jockey hired, and the player's PR Bonuses. Once you have reached your weekly limit, you will be unable to submit more until the "refresh". Each week, this <b>refresh occurs on Sunday at 11:59 PM CST</b> regardless of your own timezone and every player's limits are reset so they can begin submitting again. A countdown can be found on :devturfside:'s homepage on the right side. You can view your limit in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AIb4O65weeV30oBOP2cxirGvvUuXH2HwBlPkBn3Nqws/edit?usp=sharing">The Vault</a>.</div><div align="center"><small><a href="https://sta.sh/01x1msyutfnh#top">Back to Top</a></small></div>

<h1>TRAINER INFORMATION</h1><div class="whitebox">In Turfside, horses have <b>5 different stats</b> (Speed, Stamina, Breaking, Power, Courage) that helps determine how successful they'll be in races. In order to increase a horse's stats, you must first<a href="https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/798609698/4735584820"> hire a Trainer</a>. Once hired, the fee will be deducted from your Coin Balance and the Trainer will work for you for one IRL month. Your trainer's "expiration date" will be listed in The Vault under column "TED".&nbsp; Your "TU" shows how many trainings you have available.</div><div class="hh"><div class="ll"><div class="purplebox">There are four different Trainers types, the more expensive, the more you can train your own horses and lease others' horses!</div>

This is the same when downgrading Trainers. If you had an All-Star Trainer hired, and you fire him to hire a Rookie Trainer, your training and leasing limit drops immediately from 50 to 20. <b>If this causes you to be over your limit</b>, then you won't be able to train until the refresh and your TU is reset back down to 0.</div></div>

<h1>JOCKEY INFORMATION</h1><div class="whitebox">Racing allows players to earn coins, PR Bonuses, and rise on the leader board! But first, you must <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/798610705/4735586122">hire a Jockey</a> in order to race. Unlike a Trainer though, Jockeys don't require a fee when hired, nor do they expire. Instead, for each race you enter (whether you are entering your horses or a horse you have leased), they will take their fee out of your winnings. If you don't win enough, they'll take their fee directly from your Coin Balance!

A Jockey's contract never expires. They will remain working for you until you decide to fire them and hire a new one. Just remember, if you fire a Jockey, you'll have to hire another one before being able to race again. When you hire a Jockey, it'll be listed under "Jockey Type" in The Vault.</div><div class="hh"><div class="ll"><div class="purplebox">There are four different Jockey types, the more expensive their fee, the more often you can race your horses!</div>

</div></div></div><div class="rr"><div class="whitebox">Similar to Trainers, when you fire a Jockey and hire a new one, the benefits can be taken advantage of immediately.&nbsp;If you previously had a Rookie Jockey and you fire him to hire an All-Star, your weekly Racing Limit will jump from 20 to 50 and your fee will rise from 100c to 300c per race from that point forward.

 This is the same with downgrading Jockeys as well. If you had an All-Star Jockey and you fired him to hire a Rookie Jockey, your Racing Limit will drop from 50 to 20, along with the Racing Fee. <b>If this causes you to be over your limit</b>, then you won't be able to Race until the refresh and your RU is reset back down to 0.</div></div>

<h1>LEASING INFORMATION</h1><div class="whitebox">Each player has the option to lease out their horses to let other players train and/or race their horse, and they can also take in leases to train and/or race other people's horses. A player must have a Trainer hired to accept leases, because the Trainer determines a player's leasing limits (LL). Additionally, if a player hopes to race a leased horse, they must also have a Jockey hired.&nbsp;Unlike Training and Racing Limits, Leasing Limits can not rise through PR Bonuses. Your Leasing Limit depends entirely on which trainer you have hired. The only time your Leasing Limit will change is when you hire and/or fire a trainer.</div><div class="purplebox"><h3>IMPORTANT : Regarding Leasing Another Player's Horse to Race</h3>It is important to note that the <u>owner</u> of the horse gets the purse from winning races, but the <u>person who hired the jockey</u> must pay the racing fees. 

For example, John has a horse named "Berrys and Nuts", and he leases his horse to Walter for a race. John puts in the leasing request and Walter submits the race using his Rookie Jockey. Berrys and Nuts wins 1st place and is awarded 2,000c - but there is also a 100c Racing Fee. That fee comes out of Walter's Coin Balance because it is HIS Jockey that rode in that race, not John's. However, because it was John's horse, he gets the 2,000c. So keep in mind when negotiating leases that when YOU race someone else's horse with YOUR Jockey, then YOU are required to pay the Racing Fee, and THEY keep the prize.</div><div align="center"><small><a href="https://sta.sh/01x1msyutfnh#top">Back to Top</a></small></div>

</div>
<h1>PR BONUSES</h1><div class="mods-hh split-65"><div class="mods-column-ll"><div class="whitebox">Each time a player is awarded a PR Bonus, they <b>permanently receive +5 additional trainings and races per week.</b> This bonus adds on to the limit set by the player's hired Trainer and Jockey, <i>which are still required to make requests.</i> To earn this bonus, a player must get their horse to 100 PR by racing them successfully (see the teal box). A player can earn a maximum of 10 PR bonuses total, with bonuses only given once per horse.

For example, a player with a Rookie Trainer and Rookie Jockey would have 20 Training and 20 Races each week <i>normally</i>. But if that player were to have 10 horses with at least 100 PR, then that player would enjoy a total of 70 Training and 70 Races each week!

</div></div><div class="mods-column-rr"><div class="tealbox"><h3>Earning PR</h3>Whenever a horse does well in races, it will earn PR depending on its placement.

<div align="center"><b>1st Place</b> = 15 PR</div><div align="center"><b>2nd place</b> = 7 PR</div><div align="center"><b>3rd Place</b> = 3 PR</div><div align="center"><b>4th / 5th Place</b> = 1 PR</div><div align="center">Everything Else = 0 PR</div></div></div></div><div align="center"><small><a href="https://sta.sh/01x1msyutfnh#top">Back to Top</a></small></div>

<h1>STALL INFORMATION</h1><div class="whitebox" align="left">In order to house more horses -- whether they are obtained through buying customs, buying a horse from a player, or breeding two horses to create a foal -- you must first have space in your stable! <b>There are two types of stalls</b>; Adults and Maternal.&nbsp;You can view the stalls you own and the ones available for purchase (along with their prices) in the Vault. When you begin playing Turfside, you receive one free Adult stall to fill with your first horse!</div><div class="left"><div class="purplebox"><h3>Adult Stalls</h3>These stalls are for your Adult horses. Each player can have a maximum of 15 adult stalls, which means a player can have a maximum of 15 horses in their stables at any given time.

In order to expand your Stable to house more horses, you must purchase additional Adult Stalls. A player can unlock and purchase as many Adult Stalls they wish at any given time, as long as they have the Coins to do so. 

In "The Vault", stalls that are available for a player to purchase will have its price written in grey ink. Stalls that are owned by a player, but are unoccupied, will be labeled as "Available" with bolded black ink. Finally, stalls that are occupied by a horse will have that horse's ID# in bolded black ink.
</div></div><div class="right"><div class="purplebox"><h3>Maternity Stalls</h3>Maternal Stalls are specially made to house foals and yearlings. A stable must have at least one Maternal Stall available in order to breed their mares, although you can still stud your stallions out to other stables that have a Maternal Stall unlocked.

When a foal is born at your stables, it will live in the Maternal Stall until it ages to Adulthood. At that point, it will be automatically moved into an available Adult stall. <b>If there is no space</b>, you will receive a notice that you have two weeks to correct the issue by making space or selling the foal.

After two weeks and the issue hasn't been corrected, you will be given a second warning and an additional one week. If the problem is still not fixed at this time, your stable will be frozen and unable to participate in Turfside until the issue is resolved.
